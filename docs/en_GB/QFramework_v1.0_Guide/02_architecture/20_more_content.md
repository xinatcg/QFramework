## How did the architecture of QFramework.cs evolve?

The current version of the architecture of QFramework.cs was designed from the "Framework Construction Final Version". If you learn this course, you can have a deeper understanding of the principles and concepts of QFramework.cs, making it easier to modify and customize.

*   "Framework Construction Final Version" B station trial listening: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wh411U7X6](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wh411U7X6)
*   "Framework Construction Final Version" complete version
    *   Unity official Chinese classroom: [https://learn.u3d.cn/tutorial/framework\_design](https://learn.u3d.cn/tutorial/framework_design)
    *   Siki Academy: [https://www.sikiedu.com/my/course/871](https://www.sikiedu.com/my/course/871)
    *   GamePix Independent Game Academy: [https://www.gamepixedu.com/my/course/2](https://www.gamepixedu.com/my/course/2)

In addition, many of the tools included in QFramework.Toolkits and QFramework.ToolkitsPro are designed by QFramework.cs, and the source code of the tools themselves is also good learning material.
